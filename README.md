# DIP_Algos

This repository contains all the basic DIP algos implemented from scratch in python.

Algorithms like 

1) Bilinear interpolation
2) Nearest Neighbour
3) Shrinking image
4) Linear Contrast stretching
5) Histogram equalization
6) Histogram Matching
7) Adaptive histogram Equalization
8) Contrast limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization
9) Bilateral Filter
10) Patch based Filters


This algorithm list will be updated monthlly or might be in 2 weeks of periodic time.
